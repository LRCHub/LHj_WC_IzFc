[00:23.07] Why can't we be together?
[00:29.71] Can't you love me, don't hate me
[00:34.13] I don't see why can't we live together
[00:38.52] Baby we can get it on
[00:39.74] Maybe we can get along
[00:41.41] Assure me, oh destiny
[00:45.44] And if you wanna rise up
[00:48.08] We got a cold streak living inside us
[00:58.70] We can make this hate stop (It's all the same, all the shame)
[01:04.08] Now, don't you wanna rise up?
[01:07.18] We've been giving hate (hoohoo) a chance
[01:11.05] We got all this love to give, you know
[01:15.04] And the love will be running out for us
[01:20.59] Can't you feel that there's a life?
[01:26.24] That hope that we can still survive
[01:29.11] As the wind carries every different way
[01:36.69] So why do we see these colours?
[01:45.15] It's only skin deep, don't mean a thing
[01:49.22] So clear, I don't need this with or others
[01:53.82] Can't you see it's killing us?
[01:54.94] Can't you see it's killing us?
[01:56.78] Can't you see it's killing me?
[01:58.84] Trigger happy fantasies
[02:00.68] So stand up and be so strong now
[02:15.84] We can make this hate stop
[02:19.64] Now, don't you wanna rise up?
[02:22.39] We've been giving hate a chance
[02:26.19] We got all this love to give you know
[02:29.85] And the love will be running out for us
[02:37.04] Can't you feel that there's a life?
[02:41.61] That hope that we can still survive
[02:44.83] As the wind carries every different way
[03:04.33] 
[02:53.56] The wind carries every different way
[02:57.15] The wind carries every different way
[03:00.15] Every different way!
[03:10.15] 
[03:15.60] Now you've been taking
[03:20.26] Our dignity for too long
[03:23.30] I want to save this certainty that we hold
[03:30.79] And who's right?
[03:32.56] And who is wrong?
[03:35.48] We're not so different anyway
[03:38.37] Words are in this song
[03:43.12] Can't we stop the fighting? 'cause
[03:45.12] We've been giving hate a chance (Don't give hate a chance)
[03:49.17] We got all this love to give, you know
[03:52.96] We have all this love to give (And
[03:54.64] The love will be running out for us)
[03:58.06] I feel the love is gonna run out for us
[04:00.51] Can't you feel that there's a life?
[04:03.96] That hope that we can still survive
[04:07.38] As the wind carries every different way
[04:14.76] Don't give this hate a chance (The wind carries every dove away)
[04:19.65] We got all this love to give, you know
[04:22.63] And this tree of life will still
[04:25.84] Survive (The wind carries every dove away)
[04:28.70] Until no more people have to cry
[04:30.49] I say, don't give this hate a chance
[04:33.84] (As the wind carries every dove away!)
[04:36.99] We got all this love to give,
[04:37.94] You know (As the wind carries every dove away!)
